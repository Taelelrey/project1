                           <p>
                               Some of the most central themes of twentieth century fantasy writing include elves, witches, trolls, goblins, hidden worlds with different time streams, and a preoccupation with nature and powerful magic. Fantasy writing conjures a world not bound by reality or scientific fact, driven by very human motivations.

                               What Is Fiction Writing? Fiction writing is narrative writing that involves elements of plot and character created entirely by the author, as opposed to nonfiction, which is based on real world events and real people

                               Narrative nonfiction is nonfiction that tells a story. Unlike fiction, however, the story you're telling is true. Some other subgenres of nonfiction are narrative too: memoir, autobiography, and biography, for instance, also tell a story. With this kind of writing, it's all about telling.
